# ðŸ§¾ HomeLab Journal

This is my personal journal, a space to speak freely about my ongoing work, ideas, and thoughts around my home lab and network experiments.

Unlike the `/Documentation` folder, which focuses on clean, structured, and professional write-ups, this section is more relaxed. It's where I reflect on the *why* behind decisions, log technical roadblocks, talk through design ideas, and record general observations. Sometimes it's raw, sometimes it's insightful â€” but it's always real.
