# üßæ 2025-09-07 ‚Äì Authelia Troubleshooting & Wi-Fi Upgrade

It‚Äôs been a few days since my last update because troubleshooting **Authelia** (the MFA for my services) has been overwhelming. Every time I make progress, I hit new issues, which slows me down.

## üîê Authelia Troubleshooting

- **Current status:** Authelia itself is running, but I can‚Äôt get other services (e.g., WhoAmI, Graph.infra) working properly.  
- **Impact:** This is blocking me from moving forward with some of the fundamentals I need to configure.  
- **Browser issue:** Authelia only works in **incognito mode** on my main browser. This seems like a caching issue, which I‚Äôm still trying to fix.  
- **Effort so far:** I‚Äôve been going through the official docs and experimenting with help from ChatGPT. Progress is happening, but slowly.

## üì∂ Wi-Fi Improvements

While working through Authelia, I also realized my **AP placement was poor** ‚Äî I had the access point right next to my server, which made Wi-Fi coverage in my bedroom terrible.

### Fixes
- Bought a **30m Ethernet cable** and used about 11.5m of it.  
- **Crimped my own connectors** for the first time using an RJ-45 crimping tool. Took three tries, but the third worked perfectly.  
- Routed the cable **underneath the carpet and along the edges** so it‚Äôs mostly hidden.  
- Relocated the AP to the **center of the house** ‚Üí Wi-Fi coverage is now excellent.

### Bonus
- 3D printed a **mount for the TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 AP** using PLA+ filament.  
- The print took ~5‚Äì7 hours and came out very clean. Now the AP looks tidy and professional.

## üß† Reflections

Right now, Authelia is still the main blocker. Once I sort it out, I can move on to more exciting networking projects.  

Lately I‚Äôve been feeling a bit unmotivated, but I know the key is to **stay consistent, keep learning, and push through the frustrating parts** so I can get to the fun builds that made me start this HomeLab in the first place.
