# 🧾 2025-08-02 – Initial Journal: Kicking Off the HomeLab Journey

Welcome to my very first journal entry, this space is where I’ll translate my thoughts into text, reflect on what I’m building, and share the real-time process behind my HomeLab project.

This journal isn’t meant to be polished documentation or a formal blog. It’s a more human space, to speak freely, track ideas, and articulate what I’m thinking while I build and break things in my lab.

## 🎯 Purpose of the HomeLab

The core reason I started this HomeLab is to gain **hands-on, real-world experience** while studying for my **CCNA**, and eventually **CCNP**. I wanted a space where I could learn networking not just in theory, but by building it physically, configuring it, breaking it, and understanding it from the ground up.

This project is about building a **practical learning environment** where I can:

- Experiment with enterprise-grade equipment
- Improve and harden my home network
- Learn tools and protocols I’ll use in real-world job environments
- Document my journey transparently

## 🛠️ Current Lab Setup (as of August 2, 2025)

Right now, here’s what my environment looks like:

- 🗄️ **Server rack**: Newly installed, forming the foundation of the setup.
- 🌐 **Cisco 2960X switch**: Connected into my environment.
- 📶 **TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 router**: Connected to both my Cisco switch and Nokia ONT box.
- 📦 **Upcoming**: Waiting on my **MikroTik RB5009** to arrive, this will be the routing backbone for VLAN and inter-VLAN segmentation.

Once the MikroTik arrives, I’ll begin segmenting traffic into **VLANs** (Home, Lab, Guest, Server) and design a proper L3 topology with controlled access, DHCP relays, and potential integration with firewalls.

## 🧠 Personal Thoughts & Motivation

What excites me most about networking is the fact that it’s what allows us, globally, to communicate. Right now, as I write this journal, the only reason you’re able to read it is because of the very technology I’m learning to master.

It's kind of mind-blowing to think about how **petabytes of data** are flying around the world at near-instant speeds, data from one machine, traveling through routers, switches, cables, Wi-Fi signals, reaching another machine, potentially thousands of miles away, without a second thought.

Networking is the invisible backbone of our digital lives, and the ability to **understand it, shape it, and secure it** is what drew me to this space in the first place.

Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how computers talk to each other. But now I’m finally in a position where I can bring that curiosity into the physical world, into my own rack, my own infrastructure, my own lab.

## 🌱 Final Thoughts for Today

I spend time on r/homelab and see the incredible setups people have built — those are long-term goals. But for now, it’s all about **learning**, **documenting**, and **building smart**. This lab is my personal sandbox and my professional proving ground.

Thanks for being part of the journey — more updates to come.
