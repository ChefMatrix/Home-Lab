# 🧾 2025-10-07 – Back in the Lab

It’s been around three weeks since my last update, and honestly, I understand why.  
The gap mainly came from transitioning between jobs — finishing everything at my old role, tying up loose ends, and then learning the ropes at my new one.  

Now that things are starting to settle, I finally have the time (and mental space) to get back into my HomeLab and start building momentum again.

## 🧠 Getting Back Into It

I’ve definitely forgotten a lot of my previous configurations and setups, but that’s exactly why **documentation matters**.  
Looking back through my old notes will be my first step to catching up and refreshing everything. It’s a reminder that even when life gets busy, documenting progress keeps projects alive.

## ⚙️ Current Priorities

### 1. Network Monitoring
I want to properly monitor my entire home network — see what’s going in and out, track performance, and understand the traffic flow.  
This will also give me visibility into household network security, which I’ve been wanting to tighten up.

### 2. Media Server
The second goal is setting up a **media server** (likely Plex or Jellyfin) so I can easily download, organize, and stream content for myself and my family.

### 3. Long-Distance WAN Link
This one’s more experimental: setting up a **point-to-point wireless WAN** between my house and a friend’s nearby.  
It’ll be an expensive project, but the idea of having a shared network link between two homes sounds awesome — a mix of challenge and curiosity.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Review and refresh previous documentation  
- Set up monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus, etc.)  
- Plan media server deployment  
- Research long-distance Wi-Fi bridge options  
- Resume consistent GitHub activity and journaling

## 💭 Reflections

It feels really good to be back.  
I’m still learning the ropes at my new job, but I’m confident I can balance that while continuing to grow my HomeLab.  

The main focus now is **progress over perfection** — just keep building, refining, and documenting as I go.
