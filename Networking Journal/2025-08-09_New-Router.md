# 🧾 2025-08-09 – New MikroTik Router Day

Today was a big one for the HomeLab — my MikroTik RB5009 finally arrived.  
I’ve been waiting for this piece of kit because it’s the real backbone for the network I’ve been designing in my head for months.

Once I got it unboxed and racked, I configured it alongside my TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 in Access Point mode and my Cisco switch. It’s now officially running as the main router, handling all the routing, DHCP, and firewall duties. Everything — wired and wireless — is online with internet access.

I did run into a couple of small headaches:
- TP-Link DHCP was still running in AP mode, causing an IP conflict.
- AP Isolation blocked Wi-Fi devices from reaching the LAN.
- WAN interface wasn’t being treated as WAN because I missed adding it to the interface list.

Each one was solved quickly, but they were good reminders of how easy it is to miss a checkbox and break the flow.

Feels good to have the **core** of the network finally operational. Now I can move forward with VLAN segmentation and more advanced configurations without feeling like I’m patching things together.

Next step: designing VLANs for Home, Lab, Guest, and Server networks.
