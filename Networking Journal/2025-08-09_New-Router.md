# ðŸ§¾ 2025-08-09 â€“ New MikroTik Router Day

Today was a big one for the HomeLab â€” my MikroTik RB5009 finally arrived.  
Iâ€™ve been waiting for this piece of kit because itâ€™s the real backbone for the network Iâ€™ve been designing in my head for months.

Once I got it unboxed and racked, I configured it alongside my TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 in Access Point mode and my Cisco switch. Itâ€™s now officially running as the main router, handling all the routing, DHCP, and firewall duties. Everything â€” wired and wireless â€” is online with internet access.

I did run into a couple of small headaches:
- TP-Link DHCP was still running in AP mode, causing an IP conflict.
- AP Isolation blocked Wi-Fi devices from reaching the LAN.
- WAN interface wasnâ€™t being treated as WAN because I missed adding it to the interface list.

Each one was solved quickly, but they were good reminders of how easy it is to miss a checkbox and break the flow.

Feels good to have the **core** of the network finally operational. Now I can move forward with VLAN segmentation and more advanced configurations without feeling like Iâ€™m patching things together.

Next step: designing VLANs for Home, Lab, Guest, and Server networks.
